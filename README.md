    def calculate_effective_bandwidth(Z, D, C, N, A, K):
       # This function calculates the effective bandwidth in a communication network in deep space.
       # Parameters:
       # Z (float): The closed circuit Hurdler in the network.
       # D (float): The distance between the spacecraft and mission control.
       # C (float): The efficiency factor gained by leveraging quantum entanglement and polynomial time complexity.
       # N (float): The available bandwidth of the communication network in deep space.
       # A (float): The A—index, providing a measure of geomagnetic field disturbance at a specific location or region.
       # K (float): The K—index, measuring geomagnetic field disturbance over a 3—hour period.
       # Returns:
       # float: The effective bandwidth.
       
       # Calculate the effective bandwidth
       E=Z*C/D
       # Incorporate the Lorenz force ionosphere and the 15th star operator (Orbital spin)
       E=E*N/(15 * Z)
       # Incorporate the evolving revolutionary positive to return C++ in a negatory evolve algorithmic implication
       E=E*(C+1)/Z
       # Incorporate the A—index and K—index values to predict and assess the impact of geomagnetic field disturbances
       E=E * (A + K)/ (A * K)
       return E
